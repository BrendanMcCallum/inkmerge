InkMerge - A Mailmerge extension for Inkscape
-------------------------------------------------

This is a [Script Extension][3] for [Inkscape][4], inspired by [Aur√©lio A.
Heckert][2]'s [InkscapeGenerator][1].  I wrote this Python version so that an
open source tool would exist that I could recommend to a client who were
mass-producing similar documents on the desktop using Macs. It has also been
used in the back-end of a website generating on-the-fly scorecards.
